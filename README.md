# Effect of climate and competition on future northward migration of temperate tree species into mixedwood boreal forest

This repository contains the R code and data to retrieve the results and graphs from this "[study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2024.110892)" study. We aimed to determine if future climate and competition are factors that prevent the colonization of temperate species, i.e., sugar maple, red maple, and yellow birch, from becoming established just above their continuous northern limit of distribution.

## R packages required

- The following [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) packages: 
*dplyr*, *tidyr*, *stringr* and *ggplot*;
- the *sp*, *rgdal*, *maps*, *ggnewscale*, *ggspatial* and *raster* packages to manipulate and display spatial objects;
- the *brms*, *quantreg*, *cmdstanr* and *loo* packages to fit Bayesian model and perform model selections;
- the *xml2* package to manipulate SORTIE-ND parameter files;
- the *factoextra* and *FactoMineR* packages to compute PCA; and
- the *ggpubr*, *grid*, *ggplotify*, *gtable* and *RColorBrewer* packages working with *ggplot* package using to display results.
